# Email-Spam-Classification using Machine Learning 

## Project Summary
The Email Spam Classification project utilizes machine learning techniques to automatically detect and filter out spam emails from legitimate ones. By analyzing the content and metadata of emails, the classifier identifies patterns and features indicative of spam, such as specific keywords, phrases, and sender information. This project is crucial for improving email security and user experience by minimizing the risk of phishing attacks and reducing inbox clutter.

The Email Spam Classification effectively identifies and filters spam emails, leveraging machine learning to improve email security and user experience. The trained model, based on deep learning, demonstrates high accuracy in distinguishing between spam and non-spam emails, making it a valuable tool for reducing the risk of phishing attacks and managing email inboxes more efficiently. Future enhancements could involve refining the model to handle evolving spam tactics and integrating the classifier with real-time email systems for immediate filtering.
